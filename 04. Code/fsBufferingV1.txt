Call the readFile method from the fs module telling the method
the name of the file, the encoding type and a callback method 
that handles an error and the data received.
A callback function is simply a function we pass into another 
function so that the function can call on it at a later time. 
Callbacks are commonly seen in asynchronous APIs when the API call 
returns immediately because it is asynchronous, so we pass a function into 
it that the API can call when it's done performing its asynchronous task.
